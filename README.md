Testing Approach

The testing approach for the to-do list webapp involves automated functional testing using the Page Object pattern. The tests are designed to verify the expected behavior and functionality of the application.

Testing Patterns

The benefits of using the Page Object pattern include:

Modularity: separate the test logic from the page structure, allowing easier maintenance and updates.

Reusability: can be reused across multiple tests, reducing duplication and improving efficiency.

Readability: By abstracting the page interactions into separate classes, the test code becomes more readable and understandable.

Test Organization

The tests are organized into different categories based on the functionality being tested. Each test category is represented by a separate package or module. This organization facilitates better manageability and scalability as the test suite grows.

Reporting

The reporting of test results is handled using the TestNG framework.TestNG generates detailed HTML reports that include information such as test case status (passed/failed), execution time, and stack traces for any failures. These reports are easily accessible and provide insights into the overall test coverage and results.
